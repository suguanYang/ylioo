## A distributed system is...
> "... a system in which the failure of a computer you didn't know existed can render you own computer unusable" -- Leslie Lamport
> mutiple computers communication via a network
> trying to achieve some task together
> Consists of "nodes"

## Why?
1. It's inherently distributed
2. For better reliability
3. For better performance
4. To solve bigger problems

## Why not?
1. Communication may fail
2. Processes may crash
3. All of this may happen non-deterministically
4. Fault tolerance: hard to archive

## Networking

node 1 ---------------> node 2

1. Various network operators: home DSL, cellular data. wifi
2. Physical communication: electric current, radio waves, laser
