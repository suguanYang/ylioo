The CPU (Central Processing Unit) needs a clock for synchronization. The clock signal in a CPU serves as a heartbeat that drives the pace for all operations. When the clock ‘ticks’, it signals the CPU to proceed with the next step of a process. This helps to ensure that all components of the CPU work together in a coordinated manner.
