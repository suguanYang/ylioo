## Background

### Object-oriented programming is a Solution to Complexity
With a small number of independent parts, it gives Simplicity and
Generality which make system easy to learn, productive and maintainable.

Complex systems are hard to build with conventional programming languages.
Object-oriented programming is an approach in which software organization
corresponds closely to the system being simulated. When one supplants conventional
procedure calls with the more general mechanism of sending messages, it greatly
enhances the flexibility and reusability of software components

## Evolution

### Process
- Machine instructions
- Formulas
BASIC, symbolic instruction, programming language start uses symbols, or
mnemonics, for expressing operations and operands.
- Procedures
Lib, kit
- Structured programming
Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity,
quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of
the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition
(while and for), block structures, and subroutines.

### Data
- Memory cells
- Variables
- Data Structure
- Abstract Data Type

## Modularity

### Principle
If any part of a system depends on the internals of another part, then complexity
increases as the square of the size of the system.

## Smalltalk
- Object
An instance of some class
- Class
Defines behavior of instances
- Selector
Name of a message(member method signature)
- Message
Selector with param values
- Method
Code found in class for responding to message(member method implementation)

### Remaining problems
- Must write each class from scratch
- Many copies of same code

#### Solution
Using more Simpler and general classes, and use the Inheritance.

## Automatic Storage Management
Code should not be cluttered with irrelevant statements that may even be inaccurate.

## Essential Characteristics
- Uniform reference
everything is an object
- Uniform access
only messages
- These guarantees Simulation


## Contexts
An Object form of stack frame
Can read temporary variables
Single-step
Make simple debugger. simulator

## Exceptions
when a message not understood
<Object> might invoke debugger
<CloseFile> might re-open
<VirtualObject> might dial phone
