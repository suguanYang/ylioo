## Modules Should Be Deep
## Information Hiding
## General-Purpose Modules are Deeper
## Different Layer, Different Abstraction
## Bring together if information is shared
## Bring together if it will simplify the interface
## Bring together to eliminate duplication
## Separate general-purpose and special-purpose code
## Define Errors Out Of Existence
## Design it Twice
## Good code is self-documenting
## Comments get out of date and become misleading
## Comments Should Describe Things that Aren't Obvious from the Code
## Implementation comments: what and why, not how
## Cross-module design decisions
## Choosing Names
## Write The Comments First
## Comments are a design tool
## Modifying Existing Code
## Stay strategic
## Maintaining comments: keep the comments near the code
## Comments belong in the code, not the commit log
## Consistency
## Code Should be Obvious
## Designing for Performance
## Measure before modifying
