The coins are immutable and can only be transferred from one account to another. The transaction is the only way to transfer coins. The transaction is a signed message that contains the sender's public key, the recipient's public key, and the amount of coins to be transferred. The transaction is signed by the sender's private key. The transaction is broadcast to the network and verified by the nodes. If the transaction is valid, the coins will be transferred from the sender's account to the recipient's account. The transaction is stored in the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone.
