## Propagation delay
Amount of time required for a message to travel from the sender to receiver, which is a function of distance over speed with which the signal propagates.

## Tansmission delay
Amount of time required to push all the packet's bits into the link, which is a function of the packet's length and data rate of the link.

## Processing delay
Amount of time required to process the packet header, check for bit-level errors, and determine the packet's destination.

## Queuing delay
Amount of time the packet is waiting in the queue until it can be processed.
