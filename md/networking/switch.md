## Switch(L3 switch)
A switch is connected to a set of links and, for each of these links, runs the appropriate data link protocol to communicate with the node at the other end of the link. A switchâ€™s primary job is to receive incoming packets on one of its links and to transmit them on some other link. This function is sometimes referred to as either switching or forwarding, and in terms of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) architecture, it is considered a function of the network layer.
A layer 3 switch can perform all the functionalities of a layer 2 switch along with static and dynamic routing in layer 3. This means the layer 3 switch can operate on both layer 2 and layer 3, and forwards packets based on its IP table along with ARP tables, between multiple network segments or subnets and different virtual LANs (VLANs).

## Ethernet Switch(L2 switch)
Also know as multi-port bridges, layer 2 switches leverage hardware switching to handle a large amount of data within a single network segment or LAN. By default, most layer 2 switches use address resolution protocol (ARP) tables to enable network communication.

## Layer 3 switches and routers

### Scope	
Layer 3 switches enable data transfer between multiple devices simultaneously across LANs, VLANs, and subnets. They do not support WANs.	
Router Support for WANs, and the ability to connect multiple networks simultaneously, enables routers to be effectively used in organizations with complex network segments.

### Traffic management
Layer 3 switches offer hardware-based switching, which makes them well-suited for handling large amounts of network traffic. High throughput, high port density, and high traffic speed is enabled by layer 3 switches' hardware configurations and the ability to combine switching and routing capabilities.	
Routers typically use software-based routing, which can be slower but offers more advanced routing.
Low throughput, low port density, and low traffic management speed when compared to layer 3 switches.

### Routing protocols
Layer 3 switches typically support a limited number of routing protocols.	
Routers support multiple routing protocols, such as OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP, making them well-suited for complex routing scenarios.

### Advanced features	
Layer 3 switches do not support edge technologies and have comparably limited features for modern IT.	
Routers offer a wider range of security features, such as firewalls, VPNs, and access control lists (ACLs), along with edge technologies support.

### Cost
Switch has low cost.	
Router has high cost.
