title: "TCP Sequence Number Wraparound Handling"

Wraparound: Because the sequence number field is finite, it will eventually wrap around back to 0. TCP implementations handle this wraparound gracefully by using mechanisms like timestamps and the PAWS (Protection Against Wrapped Sequence numbers) to differentiate new data from old data and prevent misinterpretation.
