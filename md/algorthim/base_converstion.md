## 10-base
101 to 10-base

101 = (1 * 10 ^ 2) + (0 * 10 ^ 1) + (1 * 10 ^ 0)
           pt.1          pt.2            pt.3


```
101 / 10 = 10 + 1 (the quotient 10 can still be dividen, the remainder 1 is corresponding to pt.3)
10  / 10 = 1 + 0 (the quotient 1 can still be dividen, the remainder 0 is corresponding to pt.2)
1   / 10 = 0 + 1 (the quotient 0 means nothing to continue devides, the remainder 1 is corresponding to pt.1)
```

the each devide is add the weight of the quotient to the result
